      </h1>

      <p className="mt-8 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Creatives Unwind is a community-centered creative gathering rooted in
        music, culture, wellness, and nature. It exists as a safe space for
        artists, thinkers, and creatives to slow down, connect, and recharge
        through shared experiences.

      <p className="mt-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Based in Nairobi, Creatives Unwind brings together musicians, poets,

          Our Origins
        </h2>

        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Creatives Unwind was previously known as <span className="text-white">
          Hike & Art Bloom</span>, a creative wellness event hosted at Karura
          Forest. The inaugural edition brought together art, poetry, music,
          and guided nature walks as a celebration of healing, expression, and
          community.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          As the vision expanded beyond a single format, the platform evolved
          into Creatives Unwind — a broader, more inclusive home for creative
          gatherings across different spaces, editions, and disciplines.
